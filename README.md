- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sleepyworm
- 👀 I’m interested in a bunch of things, but right now I'm focused on making a game! Otherwise my interests include anything to do with Engineering (I have an Electro-Mechanical Engineering Degree!) or gaming or anime but my inerest change all the time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Character Design and Animation using things like Blender, MagicaVoxel as well as UE5 and brushing up on some other skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that sparks my interests.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
